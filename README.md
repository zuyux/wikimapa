## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wikimapa.git
   cd wikimapa
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your MapTiler API key:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY=your_maptiler_api_key
```


4. Start the development server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.


### Building for Production

```shellscript
npm run build
npm run start
# or
yarn build

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### MapTiler API Key

You need to obtain a MapTiler API key to use the map functionality:

1. Sign up for a free account at [MapTiler Cloud](https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add the key to your `.env.local` file as shown in the installation instructions
4. Alternatively, you can directly replace the placeholder in `components/map-component.tsx`:


```javascript
const MAPTILER_API_KEY = "your_maptiler_api_key" // Replace with your MapTiler key
```

### Event Data

The application loads historical event data from `public/data/wikimapa.json`. You can modify this file to add or remove events.

Each event should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-event-id",
  "type": "event", // or "building" or "person"
  "location": { "lat": 50.9116, "lon": 0.4870 },
  "year": 1066, // Use negative values for BCE
  "title": "Event Title",
  "summary": "Brief description of the event.",
  "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Title"
}
```
